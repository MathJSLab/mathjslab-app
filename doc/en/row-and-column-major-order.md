# Row- and column-major order

In computing, **row-major** order and **column-major** order are methods for storing multidimensional arrays in linear storage such as random access memory.

The difference between the methods lies in which elements of an array are contiguous in memory. In row-major order, consecutive elements of a row are next to each other, while the same goes for consecutive elements of a column in column-major order. Although the terms allude to the rows and columns of a two-dimensional array, i.e., a matrix, the orders can be generalized to matrices of any dimension, as long as the terms row-major and column-major are equivalent to lexicographic and collexicographic orders, respectively.

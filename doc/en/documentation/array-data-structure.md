# Array data structure in MathJSLab

In MATLAB&reg;/Octave there are two types of arrays: general arrays and cell arrays.

General arrays can be of any size, and can be dynamically reshaped and resized. It is easy to extract individual rows, columns, or submatrices using a variety of indexing features. All elements of a general array are of the same type and size. In general, cell arrays are like general arrays, except that their elements can be of different types and sizes. All indexing features available to general arrays is the same to cell arrays.

The general arrays is represented (and indexed) using brackets (`[` and `]`), and cell arrays uses curly brackets (`{` and `}`).

In MathJSLab, the decimal.js type is used in an object that contains the real and imaginary part to represent a number. This is what the objects contained in arrays are like.

Due to the characteristics of the JavaScript engine, arrays containing objects are arrays of references to objects that are not necessarily contiguous objects in memory. So, using objects to represent array elements, general arrays are indistinct from cell arrays in terms of the data structure they store.

In MathJSLab the only difference between general arrays and cell arrays is in the processing of inputs, especially in evaluation: general arrays nested in general arrays are concatenated. In cell arrays this does not happen. All elements (including nested elements) are evaluated and the structure of the cell array is preserved. This behavior makes MathJSLab treat general arrays and cell arrays in an equivalent way to MATLAB&reg;/Octave, even though they have the same data structure for both.

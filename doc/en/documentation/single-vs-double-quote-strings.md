# Single quote vs double quote strings

There are two types of storage for text data in MathJSLab: character arrays and string arrays. Character arrays are represented using single quotes and string arrays are represented using double quotes.


* single quotes define a character vector with size 1xN, where N is the number of characters between the quotes.
* double quotes define a string array with size 1x1 (i.e. scalar, regardless of how many characters it has). You can think of string arrays as a kind of container for character vectors.

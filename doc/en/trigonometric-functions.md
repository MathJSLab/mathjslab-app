# Trigonometric functions

In mathematics, the **trigonometric functions** (also called **circular functions**,
**angle functions** or **goniometric functions**) are real functions which relate an
angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. They are
widely used in all sciences that are related to geometry, such as navigation,
solid mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others. They are among
the simplest periodic functions, and as such are also widely used for studying
periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.

The trigonometric functions most widely used in modern mathematics are the
**sine**, the **cosine**, and the **tangent**. Their reciprocals are respectively the
**cosecant**, the **secant**, and the **cotangent**, which are less used. Each of these
six trigonometric functions has a corresponding inverse function, and an
analog among the hyperbolic functions.

The six trigonometric functions can be defined as coordinate values of points
on the Euclidean plane that are related to the unit circle, which is the
circle of radius one centered at the origin 0 of this coordinate system. While
right-angled triangle definitions allow for the definition of the
trigonometric functions for angles between 0 and %%pi/2%% radians (90ยบ), the
unit circle definitions allow the domain of trigonometric functions to be
extended to all positive and negative real numbers.

* `M = mod (X, Y)`

Compute the modulo of `X` and `Y`.

Conceptually this is given by

>> `x - y .* floor (x ./ y)`

and is written such that the correct modulus is returned for
integer types.  This function handles negative values correctly.
That is, `mod (-1, 3)` is 2, not -1, as `rem (-1, 3)` returns.

An error results if the dimensions of the arguments do not agree,
or if either of the arguments is complex.

By convention,

>> `mod (X, 0) = X`
>> `mod (X, Y)`      returns a value with the signbit from Y

For the opposite conventions see the `rem` function.  In general,
`mod` is a better choice than `rem` when any of the inputs are
negative numbers or when the values are periodic.

See also: `rem`.

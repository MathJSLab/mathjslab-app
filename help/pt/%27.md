* `'`

Matrix transpose operator or string delimiter.

For complex matrices, computes the complex conjugate (Hermitian)
transpose.

The single quote character may also be used to delimit strings.
Escape sequences within single-quoted strings are not expanded.
I.e., `'\n'` is a 2-character string `'\'` and `'n'` rather than `"\n"`
which is a single character representing a newline.

See also: `ctranspose`, `.'`, `"`.

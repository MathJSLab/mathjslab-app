* `F = factorial (N)`

Return the factorial of `N` where `N` is a real non-negative integer.

If `N` is a scalar, this is equivalent to `prod (1:N)`.  For vector
or matrix arguments, return the factorial of each element in the
array.

For non-integers see the generalized factorial function `gamma`.
Note that the factorial function grows large quite quickly, and
even with double precision values overflow will occur if `N > 171`.
For such cases consider `gammaln`.

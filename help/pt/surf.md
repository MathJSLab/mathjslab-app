Plot a 3-D surface mesh.

The surface mesh is plotted using shaded rectangles.  The vertices
of the rectangles [X, Y] are typically the output of `meshgrid`.
over a 2-D rectangular region in the x-y plane.  `Z` determines the
height above the plane of each vertex.  If only a single `Z` matrix
is given, then it is plotted over the meshgrid `X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)`.
Thus, columns of `Z` correspond to different `X`
values and rows of `Z` correspond to different `Y` values.

The color of the surface is computed by linearly scaling the `Z`
values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis'
and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

Optionally, the color of the surface can be specified independently
of `Z` by supplying a color matrix, `C`.

Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying
surface object.  The full list of properties is documented at
Surface Properties.

If the first argument `HAX` is an axes handle, then plot into this
axes, rather than the current axes returned by `gca`.

The optional return value `H` is a graphics handle to the created
surface object.

Note: The exact appearance of the surface can be controlled with
the `shading` command or by using `set` to control surface object
properties.

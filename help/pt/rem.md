*  `R = rem (X, Y)`

Return the remainder of the division `X / Y`.

The remainder is computed using the expression

>> `x - y .* fix (x ./ y)`

An error message is printed if the dimensions of the arguments do
not agree, or if either argument is complex.

By convention,

>> `rem (X, 0) = NaN`  if X is a floating point variable
>> `rem (X, 0) = 0`    if X is an integer variable
>> `rem (X, Y)`  returns a value with the signbit from X

For the opposite conventions see the `mod` function.  In general,
`rem` is best when computing the remainder after division of two
*positive* numbers.  For negative numbers, or when the values are
periodic, `mod` is a better choice.

See also: `mod`.

* `IND = sub2ind (DIMS, I, J)`
* `IND = sub2ind (DIMS, S1, S2, ..., SN)`

Convert subscripts to linear indices.

The input `DIMS` is a dimension vector where each element is the size
of the array in the respective dimension (see `size`).  The
remaining inputs are scalars or vectors of subscripts to be
converted.

The output vector `IND` contains the converted linear indices.

Background: Array elements can be specified either by a linear
index which starts at 1 and runs through the number of elements in
the array, or they may be specified with subscripts for the row,
column, page, etc.  The functions `ind2sub` and `sub2ind`
interconvert between the two forms.

The linear index traverses dimension 1 (rows), then dimension 2
(columns), then dimension 3 (pages), etc. until it has numbered all
of the elements.  Consider the following 3-by-3 matrices:

>> %%['1,1', '1,2', '1,3'; '2,1', '2,2', '2,3'; '3,1', '3,2', '3,3'] = [1, 4, 7; 2, 5, 8; 3, 6, 9]%%

The left matrix contains the subscript tuples for each matrix
element.  The right matrix shows the linear indices for the same
matrix.

The following example shows how to convert the two-dimensional
indices `(2,1)` and `(2,3)` of a 3-by-3 matrix to linear indices
with a single call to `sub2ind`.

>> `s1 = [2, 2]`

>> `s2 = [1, 3]`

>> `ind = sub2ind ([3, 3], s1, s2)`

>> %%ind =  [2, 8]%%

* `RS = gauss (A,B)`

Compute solution of system of linear equation using gaussian elimination
algorithm.

The argument `A` is a square matrix representing equations coeficients and `B` representing equation result.

This algorithm is adapted from: https://github.com/itsravenous/gaussian-elimination

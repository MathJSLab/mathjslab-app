* `[Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X1, X2, ..., Xn)`
* `[Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X)`

Given n vectors `X1`, ..., `Xn`, `ndgrid` returns `n` arrays of dimension `n`.

The elements of the i-th output argument contains the elements of
the vector `Xi` repeated over all dimensions different from the i-th
dimension.  Calling `ndgrid` with only one input argument `X` is
equivalent to calling `ndgrid` with all `n` input arguments equal to `X`:

>> `[Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X, ..., X)`

Programming Note: `ndgrid` is very similar to the function
`meshgrid` except that the first two dimensions are transposed in
comparison to `meshgrid`.  Some core functions expect `meshgrid`
input and others expect `ndgrid` input.  Check the documentation
for the function in question to determine the proper input format.

See also: `meshgrid`.

* `"`

The double quote character is used to delimit strings. Escape sequences within double-quoted strings are expanded. I.e., `"\n"` is a single character string representing a newline.

Here is a table of all the escape sequences used in MathJSLab (within double quoted strings). They are the same as those used in the JavaScript programming language with some differences.

| Escape sequence | Meaning |
| :-------------- | :------ |
| `\\` | Represents a literal backslash, `\`.|
|`\"` | Represents a literal double-quote character, `"`.|
| `\'` | Represents a literal single-quote character, `'`.|
| `\0` | Represents the null character, control-@, ASCII code 0. |
| `\b` | Represents a backspace, control-h, ASCII code 8. |
| `\f` | Represents a formfeed, control-l, ASCII code 12. |
| `\n` | Represents a newline, control-j, ASCII code 10. |
| `\r` | Represents a carriage return, control-m, ASCII code 13. |
| `\t` | Represents a horizontal tab, control-i, ASCII code 9. |
| `\nnn` | Represents the octal value nnn, where nnn are one to three digits between 0 and 7. For example, the code for the ASCII ESC (escape) character is `"\033"`. |
| `\xhhhh`| Represents the hexadecimal value hhhh, where hhhh are hexadecimal digits (`0` through `9` and either `A` through `F` or `a` through `f`). Like the same construct in JavaScript, the escape sequence continues until the first non-hexadecimal digit is seen or after four hexadecimal digits. |

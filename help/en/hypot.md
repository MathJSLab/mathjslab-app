* `H = hypot (X, Y)`
* `H = hypot (X, Y, Z, ...)`

Compute the element-by-element square root of the sum of the
squares of `X` and `Y`.

This is equivalent to `sqrt (X.^2 + Y.^2)`, but is calculated in a
manner that avoids overflows for large values of X or Y.

`hypot` can also be called with more than 2 arguments; in this
case, the arguments are accumulated from left to right:

>> `hypot (hypot (X, Y), Z)`
>> `hypot (hypot (hypot (X, Y), Z), W)`

, etc.

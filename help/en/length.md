- `N = length (A)`

Return the length of the object `A`.

The length is 0 for empty objects, 1 for scalars, and the number of elements
for vectors. For matrix or N-dimensional objects, the length is the number of
elements along the largest dimension (equivalent to 'max (size (A))').

See also: `numel`, `size`.

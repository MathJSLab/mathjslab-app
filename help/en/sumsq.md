* `Y = sumsq (X)`
* `Y = sumsq (X, DIM)`

Sum of squares of elements along dimension `DIM`.

If `DIM` is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton
dimension.

This function is conceptually equivalent to computing

>> `sum (x .* conj (x), dim)`

but it uses less memory and avoids calling 'conj' if X is real.

See also: `sum`, `prod`.

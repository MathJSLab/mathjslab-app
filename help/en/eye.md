* `I = eye (N)`
* `I = eye (M, N)`
* `I = eye ([M N])`

Return an identity matrix.

If invoked with a single scalar argument `N`, return a square `N x N`
identity matrix.

If supplied two scalar arguments `(M, N)`, `eye` takes them to be the
number of rows and columns.  If given a vector with two elements,
`eye` uses the values of the elements as the number of rows and
columns, respectively.  For example:

>> `eye (3)`

>> %%eye (3) = [1,0,0;0,1,0;0,0,1]%%

The following expressions all produce the same result:

>> `eye (2)`

>> `eye (2, 2)`

>> `eye (size ([1, 2; 3, 4]))`

Calling `eye` with no arguments is equivalent to calling it with an
argument of 1.  Any negative dimensions are treated as zero.  These
odd definitions are for compatibility with [MATLAB&reg;](https://www.mathworks.com/)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

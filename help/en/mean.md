* `mean (X)`

* `Y = mean (X)`
* `Y = mean (X, 'all')`
* `Y = mean (X, DIM)`
* `Y = mean (..., 'NANFLAG')`

Compute the mean of the elements of `X`.

* If X is a vector, then `mean (X)` returns the mean of the
elements in `X` defined as

>> `mean (X) = SUM_i X(i) / N`

where `N` is the number of elements in the `X` vector.

* If `X` is a matrix, then `mean` returns a row vector with the
mean of each column in `X`.

* If `X` is a multi-dimensional array, then `mean` operates along
the first non-singleton dimension of `X`.

The optional input `DIM` forces `mean` to operate over the specified
dimension(s).  `DIM` can either be a scalar dimension or a vector of
non-repeating dimensions.  Dimensions must be positive integers,
and the mean is calculated over the array slice defined by `DIM`.

Specifying dimension `'all'` will force `mean` to operate on all
elements of `X`, and is equivalent to `mean (X(:))`.

The optional input `NANFLAG` specifies whether to include/exclude `NaN`
values from the calculation.  By default, `NaN` values are included
in the calculation (`NANFLAG` has the value `'includenan'`).  To
exclude `NaN` values, set the value of NANFLAG to `'omitnan'`.

See also: `median`, `mode`.

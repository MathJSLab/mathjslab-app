Produce 3-D plots.

Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The
simplest form is

>> `plot3 (X, Y, Z)`

in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points
to be plotted in three dimensions.  If all arguments are vectors of
the same length, then a single continuous line is drawn.  If all
arguments are matrices, then each column of is treated as a
separate line.  No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to
make the number of rows match.

If only two arguments are given, as

>> `plot3 (X, CPLX)`

the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as the
`Y` and `Z` coordinates, respectively.

If only one argument is given, as

>> `plot3 (CPLX)`

the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the `Y` and
`Z` values, and they are plotted versus their index.

Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

>> `plot3 (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...)`

in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line
or set of lines in three dimensions.

To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group
with an empty format string, as

>> `plot3 (X1, C1, "", C2, "", ...)`

Multiple property-value pairs may be specified which will affect
the line objects drawn by `plot3`.  If the `FMT` argument is supplied
it will format the line objects in the same manner as `plot`.  The
full list of properties is documented at Line Properties.

If the first argument `HAX` is an axes handle, then plot into this
axes, rather than the current axes returned by `gca`.

The optional return value `H` is a graphics handle to the created
plot.

Example:

>> `z = [0:0.05:5];`

>> `plot3 (cos (2*pi*z), sin (2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");`

>> `plot3 (z, exp (2i*pi*z), ";complex sinusoid;");`

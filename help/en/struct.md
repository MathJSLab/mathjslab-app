* `S = struct ()`
* `S = struct (FIELD1, VALUE1, FIELD2, VALUE2, ...)`
* `S = struct (OBJ)`

Create a scalar or array structure and initialize its values.

The `FIELD1`, `FIELD2`, ... variables are strings specifying the names
of the fields and the `VALUE1`, `VALUE2`, ... variables can be of any
type.

If the values are cell arrays, create a structure array and
initialize its values.  The dimensions of each cell array of values
must match.  Singleton cells and non-cell values are repeated so
that they fill the entire array.  If the cells are empty, create an
empty structure array with the specified field names.

If the argument is an object, return the underlying struct.

Observe that the syntax is optimized for struct *arrays*.  Consider
the following examples:

>> `struct ("foo", 1)`

>> `struct {`

>> `    foo:  1`

>> `}`

>> `struct ("foo", {})`

>> %%[]%%

>> `struct ("foo", { {} })`

>> `struct {`

>> `    foo: `%%{}%%

>> `}`

>> `struct ("foo", {1, 2, 3})`

The first case is an ordinary scalar struct--one field, one value.
The second produces an empty struct array with one field and no
values, since being passed an empty cell array of struct array
values.  When the value is a cell array containing a single entry,
this becomes a scalar struct with that single entry as the value of
the field.  That single entry happens to be an empty cell array.

Finally, if the value is a non-scalar cell array, then 'struct'
produces a struct *array*.

* `N = numel (A)`
* `N = numel (A, IDX1, IDX2, ...)`

Return the number of elements in the object `A`.

Optionally, if indices `IDX1`, `IDX2`, ... are supplied, return the
number of elements that would result from the indexing

>> `A(IDX1, IDX2, ...)`

Note that the indices do not have to be scalar numbers.  For
example,

>> `A = 1;`

>> `B = ones (2, 3);`

>> `numel (A, B)`

will return 6, as this is the number of ways to index with `B`.  Or
the index could be the string `":"` which represents the colon
operator.  For example,

>> `A = ones (5, 3);`

>> `numel (A, 2, ":")`

will return 3 as the second row has three column entries.

See also: `size`, `length`, `ndims`.

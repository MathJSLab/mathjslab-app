* `X = inv (A)`

Compute the inverse of the square matrix `A`.

In general it is best to avoid calculating the inverse of a matrix
directly.  For example, it is both faster and more accurate to
solve systems of equations %%A*x = b%% with `Y = A \ b`, rather than
`Y = inv (A) * b`.

See also: `ldivide`, `rdivide`, `pinv`.

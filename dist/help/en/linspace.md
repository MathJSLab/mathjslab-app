* `Y = linspace (START, END)`
* `Y = linspace (START, END, N)`

Return a row vector with `N` linearly spaced elements between `START`
and `END`.

If the number of elements `N` is greater than one, then the endpoints
`START` and `END` are always included in the range.  If `START` is
greater than `END`, the elements are stored in decreasing order.  If
the number of points `N` is not specified, a value of 100 is used.

The `linspace` function returns a row vector when both `START` and
`END` are scalars.  If one, or both, inputs are vectors, then
`linspace` transforms them to column vectors and returns a matrix
where each row is an independent sequence between
`START(ROW_N), END(ROW_N)`.

Programming Notes: For compatibility with MATLAB&reg;/Octave, return the second
argument (`END`) when a single value (%%N = 1%%) is requested.  If `N` is
not an integer then `floor (N)` is used to round the number of
elements.  If `N` is zero or negative then an empty 1x0 matrix is
returned.

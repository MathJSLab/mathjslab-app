* `[XX, YY] = meshgrid (X, Y)`
* `[XX, YY, ZZ] = meshgrid (X, Y, Z)`
* `[XX, YY] = meshgrid (X)`
* `[XX, YY, ZZ] = meshgrid (X)`

Given vectors of `X` and `Y` coordinates, return matrices `XX` and `YY`
corresponding to a full 2-D grid.

The rows of `XX` are copies of `X`, and the columns of `YY` are copies of
`Y`.  If `Y` is omitted, then it is assumed to be the same as `X`.

If the optional `Z` input is given, or `ZZ` is requested, then the
output will be a full 3-D grid.  If `Z` is omitted and `ZZ` is
requested, it is assumed to be the same as `Y`.

`meshgrid` is most frequently used to produce input for a 2-D or
3-D function that will be plotted.  The following example creates a
surface plot of the "sombrero" function.

>> `f = @(x,y) sin (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2)) ./ sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2);`

>> `range = linspace (-8, 8, 41);`

>> `[X, Y] = meshgrid (range, range);`

>> `Z = f (X, Y);`

>> `surf (X, Y, Z);`

Programming Note: `meshgrid` is restricted to 2-D or 3-D grid
generation.  The `ndgrid` function will generate 1-D through N-D
grids.  However, the functions are not completely equivalent.  If `X`
is a vector of length `M` and `Y` is a vector of length `N`, then
`meshgrid` will produce an output grid which is NxM.  `ndgrid` will
produce an output which is MxN (transpose) for the same input.
Some core functions expect `meshgrid` input and others expect
`ndgrid` input.  Check the documentation for the function in
question to determine the proper input format.

See also: `ndgrid`, `mesh`, `contour`, `surf`.

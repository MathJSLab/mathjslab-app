* `M = min (X, Y)`

Find minimum values in the array `X`.

For a vector argument, return the minimum value.  For a matrix
argument, return a row vector with the minimum value of each
column.  For a multi-dimensional array, `min` operates along the
first non-singleton dimension.

If the optional third argument `DIM` is present then operate along
this dimension.  In this case the second argument is ignored and
should be set to the empty matrix.

For two inputs (`X` and `Y`), return the pairwise minimum according to
the rules for Broadcasting.

Thus,

>> `min (min (X))`

returns the smallest element of the 2-D matrix `X`, and

>> `min (2:5, pi)`

>> %%[2, 3, 3.1416, 3.1416]%%

compares each element of the range `2:5` with `pi`, and returns a
row vector of the minimum values.

For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for
comparison.  If the magnitudes are identical, then the results are
ordered by phase angle in the range (-pi, pi].  Hence,

>> `min ([-1 i 1 -i])`

>> %%-i%%

because all entries have magnitude 1, but -i has the smallest phase
angle with value -pi/2.

If called with one input and two output arguments, `min` also
returns the first index of the minimum value(s).  Thus,

>> `[x, ix] = min ([1, 3, 0, 2, 0])`

>> %%x = 0%%

>> %%ix = 3%%
